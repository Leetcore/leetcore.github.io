while in Andorra, it operates postal services alongside those of Spain.

In addition to postal services, it also offers banking services (with La Banque Postale) and, via Chronopost, 
courier services. After the government, La Poste is the second biggest employer in France. It also offers webmail, 
providing @laposte.net email addresses and hosts approximately 1.6 million active email accounts.  La Poste owns 
German parcel delivery company Deutscher Paket Dienst (DPD).
